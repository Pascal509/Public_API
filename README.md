PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a Flask-based REST API that provides a publicly accessible endpoint to retrieve basic information, including the developer's name, email, GitHub repository link, and the current UTC timestamp.

Additionally, the API includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing an "About" section, allowing users to:

Retrieve stored personal entries (GET /about)
Add new entries (POST /about)
Update existing entries (PUT /about/<id>)
Delete entries (DELETE /about/<id>)
